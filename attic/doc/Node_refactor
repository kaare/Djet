- New Module, Djet::Node::Box
  Lazy DB
  - A way to build up a Djet::Stuff::QueryBuilder
  Node iterator
- Djet::Context, new accessor for JNB
  Every request has a base Node::Box for the request's node
  - Djet calls JNB->find_node (refactor away from Djet.pm)
    my $node = $c->nodebox->find_node($req->path_info) || Djet::Exception->throw(NotFound => { message => $req->uri->as_string });
  - Remove $c->node?
- Djet::Stuff, No knowledge of Node
  Stuff is low-level only

- Sort out split between Stuff and Node generation
  find_node returns a Djet::Node object
  "family" methods (parent, child, etc) returns Djet::Node iterator

Relations
---------
$node->descendants							all descendants
$node->descendants('basetype')				all descendants with that basetype
$node->descendants([qw/type1 type2])		more basetypes
$node->descendants('basetype', $opt)		with options

Improvements for ->child(ren), parent(s)

$opt
	order_by
	limit
	offset

$node->descendants uses PostgreSQL's WITH RECURSIVE-construct or the node_path array (making use of the gin index)

There might be a case for choosing between returning Djet::Stuff::Result and an array of Djet::Node
Or refactor (and rename) Djet::Stuff::Result to return an array of Djet::Stuff::Row or Djet::Node.
- Or perhaps just introduce a generic iterator to handle the results.

Laziness
--------
Hopefully it will be possible to make relations "lazy", in the sense that they can gather more information before
actually being used. Examples

$node->parents('basetype')->descendants
$node->childen('basetype')->children('basetype')

Each can in effect be one sql select, offering vastly better performance

Idea
----
- node->children, ->parents, etc returns a Djet::Node::Search object
- JNO also has ->children, ->parents, etc
- Building up a search parameter list on the way.
- Also has ->next, ->all
- Fires when ->next, ->all is called
- Returns node(s)
- Possibly has parameters to in/exclude nodes on the route
