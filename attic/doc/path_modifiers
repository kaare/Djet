Path Modifiers
--------------
1. Implementation
  a) For every request, look up each path part and process its modifiers
  b) When inserting a node, let the database update modifiers from upstream
     When updating a node, let the database update modifiers downstream

2. Types
  a) pre - called on the way down
  b) post - called on the way back up

3. Examples
  a) Simple
    1. Breadcrumbs - leave a bc on the stash
    2. Make a choice based on the path part, e.g. choose language
