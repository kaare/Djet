FEATURE NAVIGATOR

Goals

Separate path finding into a class (Djet::Navigator)
 - Doesn't belong in Djet.pm
 - Should be moosifiable to allow path munging

Other

Code cleanup
 - Djet.pm shouldn't do anything, just pass information around.
 - A chance that the Node / DataNode resultset classes can be cleaner. At least *rest_path doesn't really belong there

Redirecting nodes
 - Get rid of the ridicolous 'If the basenode is a directory (ends in "/") we try to see if there is an index.html node for it'
 - Add a redirect meta. Perhaps there could be a default index.html.
 - Should work for all nodes, and should be able to redirect anywhere
