How things get done in Djet.

Djet is a PSGI application, so any Plack server can run it. Currently I'm satisfied just using starman behind an Nginx frontend, but any combination will do.

I don't think I have to explain what Plack is, or the big benefits an application has when using it, but I love the fact that I don't have to worry about
sessions, image handling, log, debugging, etc. Plack Middleware does it all.
