 - Add tag to imply there are big changes coming

1. SQL-tree
 - Remove anything but basetype, node
 - Add pathpart to node
 - Apply Depesz' SQL Tree, using SQL::Tree
sqltree --dbtype Pg --drop --table node --pk id --pktype int --parent parent_id --path node_path --path_from part > sql/sqltree.sql
 - Fix code depending on previous structure

2. JSON Columns
 - Remove data tables/views
 - Add column names to basetype
 - Add json column to node
 - Trigger to update fts w/json columns
 - Experiment w/best way to find and search nodes using json fts
 - Could be used to store subtypes, arrays, etc. Some special handling, like adding extra path rows, might be useful there.

3. Archiving
 - Bit on basetype for archiving/no archiving
 - Trigger to archive node
 - Trigger to archive path?
 - Experiment w/best way to find and display archived data

4. Context
 - Remove MooseX::Singleton and find a better solution
 - Some content follows the worker. This is truly singleton.
 - Some content follows the request. Perhaps the request could be a subclass og Plack::Request.
 - But there's a need for a global context object. Perhaps all objects should inherit from one generic Jet object (Djet::Base) with some magic.
